# Release checklist

  1. Pre-release: Check version numbers on static link script
     (`scripts/download_deps.sh`). There may be security updates! Verify that
     they work.
  2. Run a coverity scan. See https://scan.coverity.com/projects/fhunleth-fwup.
     Scans must be manually uploaded since the travis-ci integration isn't
     working. Fix issues.
  3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a bulletpoint list of new features and bug fixes
  4. Remove the `-dev` from the version numbers in `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION`. If
     doing an `rc` release, mark them appropriately.
  5. For non-rc releases, update the version numbers in `README.md`. They'll be
     broken links until the release files are uploaded, but "that's ok".
  6. Tag
  7. Push last commit(s) *and* tag to GitHub
  8. Wait for the Travis builds to complete successfully. They should work since
     no code changes were made, but wait to be safe.
  9. Check that the `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.exe`, `.msi`, and source tarball were
     uploaded properly to GitHub.
 10. Copy the latest `CHANGELOG.md` entry to the GitHub releases description.
 11. Start the next dev cycle. Start a new section in `CHANGELOG.md` and
     update the version in `VERSION` to a `-dev` version.
 12. Push changes up to GitHub
