# Build and package fwup
#
# Inputs:
#     SKIP_PACKAGE - set to "true" to skip the package making step
#     CROSS_COMPILE - if set to a gcc tuple, tries to crosscompile
#                     (e.g., x86_64-w64-mingw32)
#
# This script creates a static build of fwup to avoid dependency issues
# with libconfuse and libsodium. The result is a self-contained .deb
# and .rpm that should work on any Linux (assuming it's running on the
# same processor architecture) or an .exe for Windows.
#
# To build the Windows executable on Linux:
#  sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64
#  CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-w64-mingw32 ./scripts/build_pkg.sh
